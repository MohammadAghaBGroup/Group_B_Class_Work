        <p class="main-p">
          From the description above, we see that the tests are automated, and
          they should ensure that a small section of the application should be
          error-free. It is important to understand that this type of test is
          not the only one that software developers usually use. But it is the
          basic one. In other words, every programmer is expected to test the
          code at least at this level.

          Computer science is study of Algorithme and Algorithme is step by step
          solving of given problems vi Math or logics when we want to study
          Computer science so we shoul hav enough information in logics and in
          Math englis language is also important we can to improve ourselve in
          this field We have enough inforamtion in these field which is located

          It is the process of verifying and validating the software product to
          check whether it meets the user requirements or not as expected.
          Moreover, it also detects underlying defects, errors, and bugs that
          left unnoticed during the process of software development. As a whole,
          software testing detects software failures. Software Testing itself is
          a sub-field in software engineering and a tre.

          Databases and database technology have a major impact on the growing

          in almost all areas where computers are used, including business,
          electronic commerce, engineering, medicine, genetics, law, education,
          and library science. The word database is so commonly used that we
          must begin by defining what a database is.Our initial definition is
          quite general..

        <p class="main-p">Software programming is the act of writing computer code that enables computer software to function. The computer technology field often has overlapping terminology that can be confusing to discern. Software programming is not the same as software development. Development is the actual design of a program while programming is the carrying out of the instructions of development. People who program software are called computer programmers.</p>
